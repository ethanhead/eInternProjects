Context switching - Each thread is allowed by Windows to execute for a certain time period. 
After this time period ends, the thread is paused and Windows switches to another thread

Threads give the illusion that one CPU can execute multiple tasks at the same time. 
This way you can create an application that uses parallelism (It can execute multiple threads on different Cpus in parallel) 

Using the Thread class (System.Thread namespace)
Using Thread class is not best practice for most situations

Synchronization - The mechanism of ensuring that two threads don't execute a specific portion of your program at the same time
The Console class synchronizes the use of the output stream for you so you can write to it from multiple threads 
This means no two threads can write data to the screen at the exact same time. If one thread is using an output stream, others
will have to wait until it is finished
