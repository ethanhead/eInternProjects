CLR (Common Language Runtime)- similar to Java's JRE. 

Just In Time compiler - 

Visual studio compiles C# into msil

CLR just in time compiler will compile the msil to run on the CLR

C#

Base namespace is System.
Base class is system.object.
Base class library makes it so that you are working with stuff that has already been made for you.

C# has turned into a common intermediate language (CIL) 

dll vs .exe

dll has to be called upon, .exe has a main method 

You can use any dll from any .Net language to be taken by any language .exe

Grobal Assembly Cache (GAC) - dll is registered as public assembly (one copy) that any application can use. Deals with version-dependancy issues
Library for every type of assembly you will need. As long as the library is referenced in the GAC, it can be used by all applications

CIL is the template for the intermediate language that you want to run

CLI - common language infrastructure - protocol for compiling assembly

.Net
Consistent OOP model - Executed locally but can be distributed remotely
Code execution environment -
Better performance than scripted and interpreted environment (because scripting is less efficient because it is not translated into bytecode)

C++ turned into bytecode directly - C# is translated into msil which is translated into bytecode

Managed Applications managed by the CLR itself (talks to the operating system, returns object that is initialized 
by the constructor that you defined)- Unmanaged Applications (C++) - Do it all yourself

Arrays and Strings are immutable 

Strings are arrays of characters 

The size/structure cannot change. You need to create a new object,add the previous object to it, then delete the first place in memory

public variables should be capitolized 

Heap and Stack
Variables saved on a stack , object saved on the heap 
variables in the stack reference memory in the heap;

no memory location can be set to 0 because it is saved for null;

Structs - a reference type that is stores its data on the stack, (once the function closes, there is no access to it) It is temporary 
In C#, int,double,char,float bool are not primative types. They are structs and therefore hold memory on the stack.

Difference between reference and pointer - 

value types pass by value,  reference types pass by reference 

pass by ref in c# by using ref parameter or out parameter
