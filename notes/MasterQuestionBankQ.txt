Master Question Bank Notes

What are the advantages of stored procedures:
Maintainability
Because scripts are in one location, updates and tracking of dependencies based on schema changes becomes easier

Testing
Can be tested independent of the application

Isolation of Business Rules
Having Stored Procedures in one location means that there's no confusion of having business rules spread over potentially disparate code files in the application

Speed / Optimization
Stored procedures are cached on the server
Execution plans for the process are easily reviewable without having to run the application

Utilization of Set-based Processing
The power of SQL is its ability to quickly and efficiently perform set-based processing on large amounts of data; the coding equivalent is usually iterative looping, which is generally much slower

Security
Limit direct access to tables via defined roles in the database
Provide an "interface" to the underlying data structure so that all implementation and even the data itself is shielded.
Securing just the data and the code that accesses it is easier than applying that security within the application code itself
